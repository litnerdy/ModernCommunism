# A guide for Modern Communism in the West
Communist organisation and praxis guide. Contributions/authors/etc welcome - the more the merrier, comrades!

A growing number of us have been dissatisfied with the left's current obsession with liberal methods of organising, agitation, and propaganda. As such, we have decided to write this manual in the hopes of improving organic on-the-ground movements, as well as deliberately organised campaigns and revolutionary organisations.
